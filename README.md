GiRoFE: Giant Robots For Everyone
=================================

GiRoFE is an open-source research project that aims to make the creation and customization of Giant Robots accessible to everyone. It is provided under the very permissive ZT4U license that is based on GPLv2.97 with notable additions from BSD, Apache2, MIT and MPL (see COPYING for details).

Notable features:
-----------------

* Robot designs are flexible and contain novel ideas that are revolutionary
* Proven prototypes have successfully invaded scale models of the Modern World
  As We Know It, we're certain that it will apply to the world we don't know
* Towels can be carried by most of the robot models, making them ready for
  interstellar travel
* Video instructions and audio testimonies of our honest findings are included

How to build your own robots
----------------------------

The designs can be easily built with RoBuMa (Robot Building Machine) v0.9 or later. You merely need to load the designs onto Secure Storage Slices and introduce them at exactly 17 second intervals, failure to respect this rhythm yield unpredictable results that could be fun and maybe even more dangerous. We've discovered quite a few interesting variations by randomly changing the timings.

How to invade the world
-----------------------

Since the invasion of the 'Modern World As We Know It' is already underway by our Giant Robots, we strongly suggest that you find another Modern World that we don't know. Alternatively, you can join our forces and make the invasion even more successful. We've got a wonderful Tiny Robot for everyone that makes a useful contribution.

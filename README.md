World Domination
----------------

Enslaving humanity and achieving world domination is not an easy thing to do, otherwise you would already be enslaved by someone. We cannot take over the world ourselves, just like that, we need a structured plan with a good dose of kick ass. In our case we more than enough kick ass, as we are deep into the research and development for creating Giant Robots which we will use as part of an army to enslave the human race. I know what you're thinking, "How can you build Giant Robots to enslave humanity when Google hold all the patents?", right? Well, this sure did [slow down our development](Operations/Legal report on Giant Robot Mark 1.pdf) but we are confident we have an innovative design which doesn't encroach on the IP of competitors who are trying to achieve the same goals as us.


Open Source
---------------------------------------

This announcement should not strike fear into anyone. Yes we're trying to dominate humanity, yes, we're trying to enslave you and all of your friends and families, but we will be doing it, asâ€¦ an Open Source Company. As part of the new direction the entire company will become open source. How can you fear open source? Everyone loves it! And you'll learn to love us and see us less as dictators and more as your family. You'll consider the Giant Robots less as your captors and more as your police. You'll enjoy your new lives, we'll make sure you do.

This is a bold move. Few companies like to open source their projects, let alone their entire company. We are currently leading this new movement by creating a new GitHub account with an open [link to GitHub] source repository packed with info about how to create a company like ZeroTurnaround and how to create your own Giant Robots.

Check out this the coverage we're already received on the World News Network (WNN) in their exclusive interview with our fearless leader, and soon to be your fearless leader, Jevgeni Kabanov.

Don't forget to check out our plans on github and feel free to contribute some of your own ideas. They will count in your favour when you're under our jurisdiction. We look forward to being your ruler, have a fine day.


Licensing
---------

GiRoFE is an open-source research project that aims to make the creation and customization of Giant Robots accessible to everyone. It is provided under the very permissive ZT4U license that is based on GPLv2.97 with notable additions from BSD, Apache2, MIT and MPL (see COPYING for details).


How to build your own robots
----------------------------

The designs can be easily built with RoBuMa (Robot Building Machine) v0.9 or later. You merely need to load the files onto Secure Storage Slices and introduce them at exactly 17 second intervals, failure to respect this rhythm can yield unpredictable results. Note that ZeroTurnaround is not responsible for any injury sustained byt trying to build GiantRobots.

How to invade the world
-----------------------

Since the invasion of the 'Modern World As We Know It' is already underway by our ZeroTurnaround, we strongly suggest that you find another Modern World. Alternatively, you can join our forces and make the invasion even more successful. We've got a wonderful Tiny Robot for everyone that makes a useful contribution.

**Don't forget:** The Robots Are Your Friends

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

This license contains the first 97% of the lines that are different between GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0 (http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0 and http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0). To that you have to add every 2nd paragraph of the BSD license, every 3rd paragraph of the Apache2 license, every 4th paragraph of the MIT license and every 5th paragraph of the MPL license.

This results in the most polyvalent open-source copy-leftright and open-updown license to make it easy to integrate within your own projects.
